description = "Clarika is a geometric-based type system designed for incredible legibility suitable for both body and display uses. As a twist, Clarika is offered in both a geometric and grotesk form. Clarika Geometric, the backbone of the system, is defined by minimalism, geometry, and purity of form while Clarika Grotesk is refined by elegance, traditional form, and grotesk qualities. Its weight options range from fragile UltraThin to robust UltraBlack providing an unparalleled level of control over text weight."
