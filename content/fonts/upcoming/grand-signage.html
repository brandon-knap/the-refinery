description = "Grand Signage is inspired by old business signage found on the historic buildings of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Many of these signs are barely legible from years and years of bombarding from Michigan seasons. This leaves room for creativity while examining the chipped paint and layers of charactor from the historic heritage hill to downtown furnature city."
