<p><em>
  Greetings and welcome to The Refinery!
</em></p>
  <p>
The Refinery is a type foundry with crossover into brand identity and UX strategy. I founded The Refinery around the idea that great design is achieved through continuous refinement to concept, strategy, and craft day in and day out. It's a lifestyle.
</p>
  Originally a graphic designer, I made a shift to user experience design to pursue creative problem-solving in the digital space. I prides myself on being able to toggle between the creative, strategic, and technical mindsets to deliver intelligent designs. Having worked with emerging brands and established brands looking to extend into the digital space I've realized the power custom type design can have on a brand and the world it builds around itself.
</p>
<p>
  I believe type design is in a pivotal place with the advent of mobile devices, wearables, retina screens and an experience-driven culture. New problems and technology will call for creative type and brand experience solutions the world has yet to see.
